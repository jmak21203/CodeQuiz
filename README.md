When designing this program I would aiming to meet all necessary criteria while utilizing the code we have learned while covering Javascript. Also, wanted to generate something what would be easy for the user to understand how the program worked and users were able to successfully play the game

It solves the problem of of allowing a user to play a coding quiz game. The user can also save their scores and review them at any time. 

This was a difficult process for me. Psuedocode become my friend. Laying out the foundation of each indiviudal step and then testing to ensure it works, was a life saver. Once I pealed back the layers and used this process the program coded much easier.

Some screen shots of the program,
